            <p>
              During my time as a Junior Data Engineer at Search Laboratory, I played a crucial role in enabling data-driven decision making by collecting, transforming, and publishing data. I was responsible for designing, building, operationalizing, and securing data processing systems, with a strong focus on security, compliance, scalability, efficiency, reliability, fidelity, and flexibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, I leveraged, deployed, and continuously trained machine learning prediction models to optimize strategies. This involved developing EV (Expected Value) models to enhance customers' strategies and implementing a text extraction ML model to extract relevant information from images of websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout my tenure, I utilized a range of skills including Google BigQuery, Google AI Platform, Data Processing, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Python, Apache Beam, Microsoft SQL Server, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), and Azure DevOps. I worked diligently to ensure that the data processing systems were efficient, secure, and aligned with industry best practices.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, my contributions as a Junior Data Engineer at Search Laboratory helped drive data-centric decision making, optimize strategies, and enhance the overall data processing capabilities of the organization.
